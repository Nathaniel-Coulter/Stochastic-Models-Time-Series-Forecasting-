#Bayesian Method - measuring conditional probability of increases or decreases in Interest Rates.
#Using the interest rate Î” (Delta)
#IMPORTANT: the following code is measuring the probability of an INCREASE in interest rates based on past data obv 

#any classmates who I have reffered here will enjoy this one, all you have to do is paste 'yourdata' into 'yourdata' and run :) If you wanna give me creds that would be cool lol.
