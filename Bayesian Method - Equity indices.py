#Bayesian Method - measuring conditional probability of increases or decreases in Interest Rates using the interest rate Î” (Delta)

#IMPORTANT: the following code is measuring the probability of an INCREASE in interest rates based on past data, to measure a decrease change code where applicable 
#Otherwise, any classmates who I have reffered here will enjoy this one, all you have to do is paste 'yourdata' into 'yourdata' and run :) If you wanna give me creds that would be cool lol.
